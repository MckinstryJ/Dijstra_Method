A custom built version of Dijstra's Method.

This method...
<ol>
<li>Looks at every adj node.
<li>Calculates its distance from the starting node.
<li>Updates the node's distance, if a new path is shorter than some other path.
<li>Repeats this for every adj node to the previous adj node.
<li>If the display_path == True, then the path taken will also be displayed.

In summary, this method finds the shortest path to every node in the graph from the starting point.
